$content = "It may not seem as much, but what would one do with 5$ that you found on the floor? Some would spend it on food, perhaps their favourite. Some would keep the money for later, which could grow into a bigger fortune later. And some... 'Oi you bakayaro! I told you my Schlopfish would beat yours! This is something that someone of an inferior Clan lineage would lose to! Now hand me the money!' Shouted a young man of average height with pale skin and white hair, wearing full set of white kimono, covered by a white haori. 'What are you getting all excited for, monkey? Just because you 'won' a game of fate of luck, just because it seems to benefit you now, you seem to be awfully full of yourself' said a man with tall posture and cholocate skin complexion, throwing 2 paper bills in front of the loud young man, who seemed to be rather pleased, untill he saw what the emount of money he found laying on the ground. 'OI, 20 DOLLARS?! Jit, are you some kinda rich-man-mad-man?!' Kiol seemed to be flabbergasted, how come he bet 5 dollars on this obscure fight and got 20 in return? He was used to, even despite winning, being made the fool, often beaten up, getting robbed and well, not getting any money in return. But this tall young man appeared to have a sense of pride he couldnt sell with money, this pocket change would amount to nothing, it seems. 'Its not much for a monkey like you, may keep you alive for a day or two more, unless you wish to spend it all on betting on fighting mutant fish box fights.' It still, didnt matter! This man lost to Kiol in a fair match, had all the opportunities to walk away unscathed, however, he didnt! If he lost, then how come Kiol feels like he is the one who lost something, or perhaps its the feeling of emptiness. 'Heh, it seems that I, Kiol D Jittleyang: The Next Head of The Jittleyang Clan, understimated you and your stupid clan. However, I should gladly take up this offering, even though the winning price was 10 dollars' Kiol had no shame in taking more for granted, as that was the key to survival. It didnt make sense to give back to the rich, yet he was as honest and straightforward as one could be. As Kiol walked away with the pocket change that the tall young man fairly gave him, something seemed to be off... 'Where the fuck is he going...' Not even 5 minutes have passed since then, till the tall young man witnessed something that one could only imagine happening in their dreams, the loud young man, who claimed to be The Next Head of The Jittleyang Clan, was once again, betting everything he had on an obscure fight of Schlopfish, which are mutated fish who grew arms and can breathe air. Surprisingly, fate was on his side and the loud young man won! With his betting price being 20 dollars, he now won 40 dollars! Or so he should, untill the person he played with just walked away as if nothing ever happened. 'This is simply a game, geez. Did you perhaps actually try to win some money this way? Go get a job, kid' Said the arrogant man that Kiol played against, but Kiol didnt take no as an answer. 'Whenever you stake something in a game, you should be fully prepared to give it. I may seem like a fool, but I never bet on something I dont have or cant give. So if I bet it all for this god damn chance, and you feel like you can just walk away simply like that..' Before the young man could finish his sentence, a straight punch landed on the mans face, making him stagger. 'THEN DONT BOTHER LIVING, YOU TRASH!' Things escelated fast, the young man, aklthough appearing to be average, has trained in martial arts for years and has been in countless battles. However, this cruel reality is one where hard work doesnt mean much when you are up against sheer numbers and tools of destruction. The man grabbed his knife and aimed it at Kiol, ready to throw one. Many people appeared, surrounding the young man. This time, he would probably end up with more than just a simple beating to half death... Which is what most likely wouldve happened if not for a simple irregularity. 'Larjuro, you can call me Lar, or Migshibo, or the Fuhulatogaan Clan Demon, or whatever you want.' The young man stormed the place, soon, everyone started falling one after another. With his great speed, he managed to put everyone except the Kiol to sleep. 'N- NANIII' Kiol shouted. 'Just who is this jit' are the first thoughts that came into Kioljits mind. Not only did he beat everyone in a fair fight, he stood straight up in front of him, and the craziest part is, that he himself won against this man! 'Im here for the money' Said Lar. However, Kiol already used it on betting. So he won 40 dollars by today, he could give him the 20 dollars or the 40 dolalrs. It only seemed fair, as Lar originally gave Kiol twice as much money as he shouldve gotten. So Kiol took wallets of the people that laid on the ground, untill he realised that, none of them had any money! Did they really try to gamble against him without any money? Thats not it, its just that this freakishly fast bastard of The Fuhulatoogan Clan already managed to take it all for him. 'Is that why you came here for? To rob people?' Asked Kioljit, being confused. 'Is it really a robbery if the people are already robbed of their pride? What would they need this amount for?' Lar gave Kiol a wallet, this one is his! When he looked inside it, he found money that amount to 80$! It makes no sense, every time this man is around, he is always bound to fortune! He also found a 10 dollar bill with a drawing that Larjuro threw to Kiol after their very first game. Lar noticed Kiol looking at the bill 'I will take that back, just not now. I only need something from someone stronger than me, I dont have any need for it now.:'. 'What is he talking about' wondered Kiol in his mind, he doesnt care about giving it back! As today is his lucky day, he wondered what he should do with this money. 'Hmph, Larjuro of The Fuhulatoogan Clan, you are truly strong. Itd be a waste to have you walking around in the streets, dealing with thugs and helping out strangers. Thatss why, Im here! I offer you to join the one and only Propotious Jittleyang Clan! We shall rule over this cursed world, hold the fate and show these mortals what were capable of!' Said Kiol, trying to strike a deal with this man. He knew that, maybe together with this man, the fate could be shackled! 'Nah Im good', those are the words that came from the calm wandering tall young man. 'H- hmph! Its not like I wanted you to be in my clan or something, you baka!' muttered Kioljit, is he some kind of tsundere? 'I will fight against fate my own way, you and whateve your Jeet Lyang Clan may be, I trust you have more waiting for this universe, dont you?' Asked Lar. And so, the 2 lone wanderers, although not on the same team, they just now knew of each others names, have now created a promise not of words, but of something much more.";
